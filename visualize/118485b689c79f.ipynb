This lends the phenomenon naturally to a time series analysis problem. Sunspots are measured using both ground-based and orbiting solar telescopes. Observing and studying sunspots presents an excellent window into understanding solar (and hence stellar) physics, particularly the solar cycle. The solar cycle is a roughly 11-year cycle of solar activity characterized by changes in the magnetic field activity generated by the sun. Sunspots are regions of high concentrations of magnetic field on the sun's surface, and are cooler in temperature compared to their surroundings. Rising solar activity is associated with the outburst of energetic particles outward from the sun which affects the Earth's upper atmosphere, making sensitive instruments in space vulnerable to damage. Moreover, solar activity also possibly affects terrestrial climate. Studying the time variation of sunspot numbers provides a cheap and easy way to continuously monitor, understand and predict the various effects of the solar cycle."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "3ab779db", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We will perform the following tasks:\n\n1.

Show that the interquartile range itself displays seasonality and coincides with the solar cycle.\n\n4.

This may be challenging, however, due to lack of enough data."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "b7d77fb9", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# References\n\n1. \"The Solar Cycle\", David H.
